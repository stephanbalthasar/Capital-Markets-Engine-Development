    "description": "Neon AG is a German stock company (Aktiengesellschaft)... Unicorn will transfer the licences to Neon by way of a capital contribution in kind (Sacheinlage). In return, Neon will increase its share capital by 30% and issue the new shares to Unicorn. The parties agree that the capital increase should take place within the next 6 months. Unicorn and Gerry agree that, once the capital increase is complete, they will pre-align major decisions impacting Neon’s business strategy. Where they cannot agree on a specific measure, Gerry agrees to follow Unicorn’s instructions when voting at a shareholder meeting of Neon. As a result of the capital increase, Gerry will hold approximately 19% in Neon, and Unicorn 23%. Unicorn, Neon and Gerry know that the agreement will come as a surprise to Neon’s shareholders, in particular, because in previous public statements, Gerry had always stressed that he wanted Neon to remain independent. They expect that the new strategy is a “game-changer” for Neon and will change its strategic orientation permanently in a substantial way.",

    "title": "Brabo's takeover plans (Exam 2025-2)",
    "description": "Brabo AG and Texxie AG are German stock companies (Aktiengesellschaft) whose shares are admitted to trading on the regulated market of the Frankfurt stock exchange. On 3 February 2025, Brabo’s management board (Vorstand) and supervisory board (Aufsichtsrat) resolve to “examine pros and cons of a possible takeover bid for Texxie. The decision on whether to launch a bid is reserved for a later date once a detailed analysis is available. On 4 March, Brabo acquires 15% in Texxie shares from Texxie’s major shareholder. In April, Brabo starts raising funds for the takeover bid. On 7 April, Brabo posts the following message on social media: “Brabo investors are given a unique opportunity to invest in the success of Brabo: Investors can subscribe for a non-listed bond with a denomination of 1,000 euros, an interest rate of 7% and maturity on 1 December 2030. This is not a binding offer. Further information on terms and conditions and on how to purchase bonds can be requested by email to investors@brabo.com.” Brabo does not, however, publish a securities prospectus. On 2 May, Brabo’s management and supervisory boards approve the bid and Brabo announces its intention to make a voluntary takeover bid. The offer document is published on 10 June, and 25% of Texxie shareholders accept the offer. After settlement in August, Brabo holds 40% in Texxie.",
    "questions": [
      "On 3 February, Charly, the CEO of Brabo, asks you whether there is any immediate obligation for Brabo to make public the board resolutions in relation to Texxie. It is clear that, if disclosed to the public, the resolutions would lead to wild speculations in Brabo shares with significant price changes, and share prices may change abruptly and significantly in both directions."
      "On 4 February 2025, Eric, an employee representative on the supervisory board asks whether it is legal for him to inform Jake, a well-known journalist, about Brabo’s plans in relation to Texxie."
      "Does the acquisition of 4 March 2025 trigger disclosure obligations for Brabo? If yes, what exactly does Brabo have to disclose? For the moment, no decision has been made whether and when Brabo will launch a bid."
      "Irisia AG is a qualified investor within the meaning of article 2(e) PR and acquired Brabo bonds for €10,000,000. When Irisia learns about Brabo’s takeover bid, its management is concerned about the prospects of Brabo and asks whether it can unwind the bond transaction." 
      "Does the acquisition of the 40% stake trigger an obligation for Brabo to make a mandatory takeover bid?

    "model_answer": "Question 1.	Candidates are expected to discuss whether Brabo’s plans qualify as inside information and whether this triggers a disclosure obligation pursuant to article 17 MAR. a)	Candidates should mention that while the resolutions are “intermediate steps”, they still qualify as inside information pursuant to article 7(4) if the elements of the definition in article 7(1)(a) MAR are met (a good answer might mention the ECJ decision in Geltl). The discussion should focus on whether the resolutions are “precise” within the meaning of article 7(1)(a). A good answer would confirm that this is the case on the basis of the ECJ decision in Lafonta. likely to have a “significant effect” on prices. Students should identify article 7(4) as the basis for their analysis and conclude that in the case at hand, the information is likely to create an incentive to trade as required by article 7(4).  b)	Candidates should then go on to discuss whether there is an obligation to disclose pursuant to article 17(1)(1) MAR. Candidates should conclude that pursuant to § 10(6) WpÜG, Brabo has no disclosure obligations under article 17(1) MAR for the moment. A good answer would discuss whether German domestic law (§ 10(6) WpÜG) can displace a disclosure requirement under EU law (article 17(1) MAR), and point to article 6(1) TBD as a justification. Candidates also should discuss whether, aside from § 10(6) WpÜG, Brabo could delay disclosure pursuant to article 17(4) and discuss the three requirements under that provision. Question 2.	Candidates should identify the prohibition of unlawful disclosure of inside information pursuant to articles 14(c), 10 MAR and discuss the exception pursuant to article 10(1) (“normal exercise of an employment”). A good answer would mention the ECJ case law in Grongaard and argue for a restrictive application. On the basis of Grongaard, candidates should conclude that E cannot legally disclose the information in question. A very good answer would go on to discuss this conclusion in the light of article 21 MAR, and ideally also mention the ECJ decision in Hermès. Question 3.	Candidates should in any event identify that there is a straightforward requirement to disclose crossing/reaching the 3, 5, 10 and 15% thresholds pursuant to § 33(1)(1) WpHG. A good answer should also identify the requirement to publish a statement of intent pursuant to § 43(1) WpHG. A very good answer should discuss whether § 43(1) requires disclosure of the takeover plans. The wording of § 43(1) suggests this is not the case (it is only required to disclose whether additional purchases are intended, but not their volume or whether this is intended to acquire “control”), and legal writers support this view. A very good answer might mention § 10(6) WpÜG to support this view. Question 4.	Candidates should identify §§ 9(1), 10(1) in conjunction with § 14(1) WpPG as a basis for liability for a missing prospectus and conclude that the case at hand involves an “offer of securities” within the meaning of articles 3(1), 2(d) PR. A good answer would mention the EFTA case law in ADCADA when discussing whether there is an “offer to the public”. A very good answer would also discuss: whether Irisia is precluded from raising prospectus liability claims on the basis that it is a qualified investor to whom securities could be offered without a prospectus altogether (article 1(4)(a) PR); arguably, the wording of the WpPG and the ECJ decision in Bankia suggest Irisia can still rely on prospectus liability whether prospectus liability is precluded under § 14(4) WpPG; arguably, this requires positive knowledge of the breach of prospectus requirements, and the mere fact that Irisia is a qualified investor is not sufficient to conclude such knowledge existed. Question 5.	Candidates should identify that acquiring 40% qualifies as “control” pursuant to § 29(2) WpÜG and that this requires in principle a mandatory bid, § 35(1) WpÜG. Candidates are also expected to conclude that the case at hand is covered by the exemption according to § 35(3) WpÜG."
