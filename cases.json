    "description": "Neon AG is a German stock company (Aktiengesellschaft)... Unicorn will transfer the licences to Neon by way of a capital contribution in kind (Sacheinlage). In return, Neon will increase its share capital by 30% and issue the new shares to Unicorn. The parties agree that the capital increase should take place within the next 6 months. Unicorn and Gerry agree that, once the capital increase is complete, they will pre-align major decisions impacting Neon’s business strategy. Where they cannot agree on a specific measure, Gerry agrees to follow Unicorn’s instructions when voting at a shareholder meeting of Neon. As a result of the capital increase, Gerry will hold approximately 19% in Neon, and Unicorn 23%. Unicorn, Neon and Gerry know that the agreement will come as a surprise to Neon’s shareholders, in particular, because in previous public statements, Gerry had always stressed that he wanted Neon to remain independent. They expect that the new strategy is a “game-changer” for Neon and will change its strategic orientation permanently in a substantial way.",
